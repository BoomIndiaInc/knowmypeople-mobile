Q1. [ERROR] Unable to find command: deploy add ionic deploy - (paid) Appflow Deploy functionality

[ERROR] Unable to find command: deploy add

  ionic deploy - (paid) Appflow Deploy functionality

    Interface to execute commands about deploy builds on Ionic Appflow.
    
    Appflow deploy documentation:
    - Overview: https://ion.link/appflow-deploy-docs

  Usage:

    $ ionic deploy <command> [<args>] [--help] [--verbose] [--quiet] [--no-interactive] [--no-color] [--confirm] [options]

  Project Commands:

    build ........................... Create a deploy build on Appflow

    Answer:-

    So I run 
    npm install -g ionic@latest, 
    npm install, restarted and run 
    npm i -g native-run and now 
    ionic deploy add 
    
    is working. I can’t tell which solved the problem and I’m glad it’s.
